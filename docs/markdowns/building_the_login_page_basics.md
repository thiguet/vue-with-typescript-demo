# Vue With Typescript And TDD (VWT) - Part 1

So this is my first post (YAY!!!). 

I was just an Angular JS and PHP Web Dev, which thought he knew JS. And all I wanted was to learn:
- TDD
- Typescript
- Vue JS (dive deeper into it)

So I've mixed then all together and built this [repo](REPO)
So if that's what you're looking for, let's go.

# Motivation 

Why? I really just saw some pros and cons. And the pros were like exactly what I was looking for. 

My perspective is from a developer's eye. I'm poiting out what I've seen so far doing it and reading about it.

Definetly these pros and cons do only apply when we implement things according to the correct way of using TDD, Typescript and Vue as well.

Here's a small list:


## TDD:

One of my favorites. It is about: Testing first and then implementing.

You should follow the TDD cycle: 

- Test something, 
- then make it pass the test. 
- Finally refactor your code.
- Do it all again, while you can.

Don't forget: It is a cycle! :smile:

#### Pros:  
  - Rely that your code runs as you've tested it once.
  - Easily identify when your refactor and it fails or doesn't work.
  - You don't need to test it in production anymore.
  - Refactor you code without being scared of not working.
  - Definetly spend more time thinking in how good is the solution, since first you need to define your problem first (  :star: ).
  - Code coverage of 100%. ( :star: ).
### Cons:
  - You must learn it, and by learning you spend time.
  - Sometimes you see yourself doing non unitary tests and have to rethink what you're doing.
  - Most of the times you NEED to review it's concepts.
  - The bigger your test get, the more you should think of refactoring the test.
  - (Today is 22, September 2020) You'll find more material over programming stuff itself than about testing these same stuff.

One of the best things is mocking things. When you get how and why we do that, made me a better programmer.

# Typescript 

The son of JS, which evolves our beloved weird lang to a strong typed one. 
Some benefits come from having OOP principles.
